# Postchi
**A Social App Manager Panel**  
Postchi(پستچی) is a Persian word that means “postman” in English, or someone who delivers letters.

## What does this project do?
Initially, it can be used for managing Instagram professionally. If this project gains attention from many users, more capabilities and support for additional social apps like Facebook, Telegram, etc., will be added. Verified APIs that Meta provides developers for Instagram will be used, and features that give users full control over Instagram, such as auto-follow and unfollow (with custom criteria), auto-post, page analyzer, AI assistant and AI post maker, auto-reply, etc., will be added. I will create step-by-step video tutorials on how to make this web app for enthusiastic programmers and upload them on my YouTube channel.
